// NOTE: You can say that this the boiler plate code of c language...

// HACK: This line is a preprocessor directive that tells the compiler to include the standard input-output header file `stdio.h`. This header file contains declarations for input and output functions such as `printf`
#include <stdio.h>

// HACK: This is the main function which is the entry point of the program
int main()
{
    printf("Hello World"); // Prints hello world
    return 0;              // return 0 (means function end)
}
